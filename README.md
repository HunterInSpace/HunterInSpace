- 👋 Wassup, I’m @TurtDev!
- 🤖 I primarily make discord bots for a variety of reasons (mainly Smart Home Automation :])
- 🌱 I am a big beginner in python and I'm still learning every single day
- ✔️ The projects i am working on the most are for sure [RokuBot](https://github.com/TurtDev/RokuBot) and [FireTVBot](https://github.com/TurtDev/FireTVBot)
- 🤔 *Wait what do these bots do?* Both RokuBot and FireTVBot are discord bots that can remotely control Roku/Amazon Fire TV's, its like a TV remote but in a discord bot!
- 📫 The best way to reach me is on discord at ***Turt#6564***
